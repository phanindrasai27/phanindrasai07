Recently, our PUBG squad got recalled and we started playing again. It made me think how big a role PUBG played in mine and many people’s lives, how much it made our lives better and gave us experiences that nothing else did. I just tried to roll out exactly how PUBG captured a diverse market, its strategy, and how it adapted to customers' pain points, all from my own experience of playing it.

I have been a great addict of this game, especially after getting a phone post literally five years of peak hostel (jail) experience. When I got my first own mobile phone in 2019, I played PUBG like crazy. Initially, I played just to kill people, for the experience of the game. The fact that I was killing real people and not some bots made it so much better.

It was so addictive that I bunked classes to play it. I used to binge-watch streams and videos of big creators like Mortal, Regaltos, and more. The best thing about PUBG is that it’s as fun to watch as it is to play. Initially, it was all about the stats, experience, kills, skins, and more. But now, it’s like a digital chai tapri where my friends from three different states meet and play once in a while.

I always look up to those COVID days where I played, ruled, and was a pro. I played 12 hours a day and binge-watched scrims even while being COVID positive. The journey of just wanting to play the game to now being a digital gathering space for our generation is a very heart-touching strategy that PUBG played over the years.

## Tech

I don’t want to go into their system design, languages, or tech stack. I honestly don’t know much about that. But I know their game was optimized, diverse, and could run from a ₹15K Redmi to a ₹1.5L iPhone.

Sure, there were bugs, lag, ping issues, and much more. The gaming experience for low-end devices was often unfair compared to high-end ones. But still, it’s damn hard to make everything work. Their graphic packages for low-end phones were totally different, and you had control over what to download — skins, maps, whatever.

The full install might go up to 50 to 70 GB, but you could still play it with just a 64 GB phone on low graphics. This is pure consumer targeting even at the tech level. Yes, the experience between someone playing on a Redmi and someone on an iPhone is very different. But at least there’s a game to play.

This same diversity also destroyed sleep cycles, mental health, and many phones, but that’s the cost of something so massive.

## Monetization

All my PUBG friends and I played for 3 years, especially during peak COVID, without buying a season pass. Even then, PUBG never felt like it was forcing us to buy skins or costumes. They definitely wanted to monetize, and they did it in the best way.

Some people like feeling special, so they buy season passes. Once you have it, you can keep unlocking more. Some are esports players, streamers, or just rich folks who spend a lot opening crates and collecting rare items.

Some people only play for that casino vibe. You may not have great stats or skills, but when people see you on the plane or in the kill feed, you look like a star. I know people who only bought one season pass, and some got it for free by completing missions.

I never bought it. A friend gave me one, but I didn’t keep it. You could spend thousands of rupees on UC and open endless crates. But once you start spending, it stops feeling like a survival game. It becomes a fashion and aura game with gameplay as an add-on.

Still, you don’t need to spend a single rupee to enjoy the core experience. The game was always for everyone, not just those chasing status. Of course, there were loopholes, like fake credit card scams to get 100x UC. That’s a whole other dark side, especially among esports players and streamers.

## Experience

Honestly, I don’t know any other game that captured players like PUBG. It’s not just a game, it’s an emotion.

Now it’s more fast-forward and casual, but back when I played, the tension, anxiety, and intensity were real.

### 1. Classic Games  
In 2019, we had 4 classic maps, each lasting 30 to 45 mins. You needed strategy. You needed to camp, rush, rotate, and act on instincts. Erangel was the soul of the game, so nostalgic, so detailed. The vibes, the emotion, the design, all on point. The other maps were great too, but Erangel was home.

Then they introduced Livik, a short, beginner-friendly map. OGs usually avoided it. Later came Ultimate Royale, no bots, pure scrims-style competition.

They also added seasonal modes with 3 recalls, die three times, come back again. It turned into a kill-fest. No time to think. But the old classic mode was all about real gameplay and decision-making.

### 2. TDMs  
4v4 warehouse fights, chill, silly, fun. Good for warming up or passing time while waiting for your squad. Not as famous now, but a classic time killer.

### 3. WOW Mode  
This is pure innovation. Users can create their own maps. If approved by BGMI, they go live. So much creativity, newness, and fresh experiences.

## PUBG’s Strategy: Listening, Adapting, Innovating

PUBG started with its own game idea but kept watching what people wanted. Some wanted fun, some wanted raw competition, some wanted nostalgia. PUBG gave everyone something.

Didn’t like seasonal craziness? They gave you Ultimate Royale. Wanted fun, quirky modes? They gave you WOW. Didn't like the current season? Skip it. But you’ll probably come back for the next one, because the hype was always real.

Marvel crossovers. King Kong events. Custom outfits. Nostalgia. Innovation. They tried to win everyone back, always.

## Building a Creator Ecosystem

PUBG wasn’t just fun to play. It was amazing to watch. Whole esports organizations in India were born because of this game. No other game had that kind of viewer engagement.

From crate opening reactions to sweaty gameplay to fun streams, content creators blew up. People built entire careers just by going live and vibing. Not everyone had insane skills, but the confidence to show up and perform made the difference.

You know the story of Dynamo. And honestly, anyone practicing daily with the right gear and some mentorship could eventually become good.

In 2018 to 2020, this was the ultimate window to make money from gaming, especially during COVID, when I watched scrims for 5 hours and played 10 more.

## PUBG vs The World

While the U.S. focused on PC, PS5, and Xbox games, PUBG Mobile quietly captured the real market.

They understood something others didn’t. A mobile phone is a luxury in many countries. Forget about a gaming PC or a console. PUBG didn’t just aim for inclusivity, they delivered it.

They didn’t give you a premium experience. They gave you the best possible experience within your 100 limitations.

Yes, Rockstar Games made legendary titles. But the one company that made my life, and millions of lives, better?
