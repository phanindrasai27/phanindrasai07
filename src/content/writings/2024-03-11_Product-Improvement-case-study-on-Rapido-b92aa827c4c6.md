Hey, people. past 6 months i have read many case studies regarding product design, improvement and guesstimates.

As i wanted to challenge myself. i am writing this case study on rapido.

## Why Rapido over other ride hailing apps (my opinion)?
- Provides bike as a service. Which is very useful for solo travellers.
- More affordable compared to other apps even in demand times.
- Provides part-time for students, non educated people and more as bike being also a category.
- Rapido made a great positioning of their app that seems it is more affordable and easy to use in my perception actually.

## User personas:
- X — 22 year old college student uses while he missed his college bus.
- Y — 25 year old group of friends using auto for urgent movie they don’t wanna be late or a train they don’t wanna miss.
- Z — 35 year old office employee who choose comfort after a long working day.
- 50 year old uncle booked by his son for not being comfortable table in public travel.

We mostly want to prioritise X, Y, Z as they will be the prominent users of this app being tech savvy and as their schedule being tight over the day. They wanted to move fast and choose comfort over public transport. Being rapid is very affordable most of the times.

## User Journey:
- Opens the app
- Search for the destination.
- Matches with the rider.
- Tells the pin to the rider.
- Reaches destination.
- Pays the charge and rates his experience and rating.

## Pain points:
- Rider asking for extra charges over call or before start of the ride.
- Rider using a very bad conditioned bike, which makes consumer uncomfortable.
- Mid Night rides for Girls or students may seem very anxiety, intense and unsafe.
- Rapido have a feature where it will change the price dynamically if he goes by long route to earn more rider is driving longer routes which is making the charges 30 to 40 % more pricing over initial shown price.
- Visitors and tourists when they come to new city it will be very confusing for them to where to travel and what are the best places to visit mainly in the tier -1 cities and metropolitan cities especially.

## Solutions:

### Combined solution for the pain points 1, 2, 4:
- As rider charging extra has become an every driver thing and they are doing this thing as group by many auto drivers especially. But as rapid have bike service too mostly bike services people are part time students. They don’t ask as they are more genz. If we take any decision on this riders may change the app and may go to another company. So we don’t take any harsh or serious decisions as this is the problem for every riding apps. as you may see this pain points are in every App we don’t wanna make them move to other apps. As you know RIDER > CONSUMER in terms of business. If there is no RIDER obviously there will be no CONSUMER.The best solution would be taking a final survey of the rider from consumer asking:
- Does driver asked for extra money?
- Does your ride is comfortable? Does the riders bike is in good condition?
- Does your rider came here by correct route or have used a long route?
- The rating of the rider will be as normal as that for them but this three question survey will be very confidential and we will not make them seeing for the consumer as well as the rider. We make a AI ranking model by which the riders are ranked as per their great survey metrics. Off course we will consider riders rating while matching the rider but we will also use this ranking mechanism inside. By which the great, safety and great services drivers can get the service faster as compared to a non efficient and not very deniable person.

### Solution for Midnight Rides for women:
- Present rapido added helpline call for every 5 mins. This is good but whenever a girl travels they mostly share their live location. If we make the consumer live app page share to their parents, brother or friends it will be great. If by any chance the driver goes on wrong way rather than rapid way the consumer phone should vibrate immediately. By which the consumer can question the rider why he too the wrong turn.

### Solution for New visitors to tier 1 cities:
- We make a new category in the opening page that what are the places that he can visit and we make that page look like a map journey. That consumer gets to know more about the cities famous and historical places.
- By this nature we make even other app people to install our app because we have a great visual guide and great way to tour a city.
- We show them all places they visit.
- We can make an offer or cashbacks to the consumers. By this the chances of tourists and people using this app for the Tavel will be high.

### Main objectives for the solutions/ features:
- To match best rider as possible — — Survey at last from consumers about their ride on 3 to 4 points and make it confidential.
- To make our app Safe as possible — — adding page share and vibrating features to make consumer aware and on track whole ride.
- To engage more consumer — — add a new feature page regarding famous and historical places a visual tour guide and give cashbacks and more to convert consumers.

## Prioritisation of Features/ solutions:
- I will give 1st priority to Features 1, 2 as they make our current consumers experience more greater and safer.
- I will give my 2nd priority to new visual tour guide feature to get more engagement and more consumers.

## Success Metrics:
- No of consumers giving the survey at the end.
- No of rides having the great surveys.
- No of rides are charging as per the app.
- No of rides are having comfortable ride.
- No of rides are riding through the app shown route.
- No of women using ride share feature.
- Rides increase in midnight after feature 2 release.
- No of people clicking or seeing visual tour guide feature.
- No of trips done/ whole trips in the visual tour guide.
