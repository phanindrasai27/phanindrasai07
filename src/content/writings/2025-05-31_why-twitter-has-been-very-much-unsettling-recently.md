Initial context: Few of the things I’m spreading here are my formation of how I perceive Twitter as a social media. I consume cringe, informative content, memes, and more roast or whatever content from Instagram, and I feel it's hooked and cooked so good.
I don't expect X as a platform to cater me cringe, shitposts, maybe surprising or informative facts or content rarely. But my core usage is debating over everything. More like wrestling my ideas, perceptions, and others’ perspectives around anything from product, business, AI, psychology, philosophy, and whatnot.
What makes me be in here is — many of the creators of the apps, businesses, content, and more are present here, and you might get a chance to debate or discuss around their creations or anything. If everything was from randoms, I might have left this platform so long ago. But we can literally interact with people, post your work and get traction, make your startups, creations, and more work.

My feed is full of cringe, utter scrap, shitposting, meaningless rizz on people, worshipping others because he followed me, and more. Make some micro communities and start doing utter vibing rizz and identifying “we are close and we are this.”
Bruh, if you have a micro community then why do you do all this shit here? Go and do it in your WhatsApp communities. Most of the people who are shitposting are doing it for the money that comes from X. Nothing real. They are just using this page for the shitposting, that’s it.

I often see edgy people here, who often come up with debating from the unfair side or the other side of most people just so you get the engagement and more — so that you get paid in the end.

Many people don't even want to post. See, anything free in the world, or especially India, makes you want more — even if your body or mind doesn't. In the end, it's either they wanted to make something work and just sell it, and now as Elon made it quite easier, it all went down so fast.

As engagement is the criteria for payment, they made micro communities of themselves and keep on rizzing on one another so that they get what they wanted.

Glorification of high-paying labour people. Keep on hyping their useless job hustle, a random usecaseless product they made without sleeping. The gap between trying to showcase their work, inspire, and trying to make big and to infuse FOMO, useless hustle, and more — the gap is so narrow and many people always try to fall on the other side of it.

Wanting to maintain the celeb aura — now, as everyone can make their own blue tick. There will be a random person who thinks he is an outlier in their specific college and is trying to make a specific identity for himself in here. But once they get a few followers, they start making their following count so low and try to act as a celeb. The energy they spread is so hilarious and prodigy kinda stuff.

Prodigy stuff — I often see many 19-year-olds always benchmarking themselves as prodigies and keep on posting that they built this in 19 years and cracked that in just 18 years and more. I’m obviously very, very far off from the idea of prodigy and even the idea of becoming one. This is very misleading for many people who are not so enlightened about this world.

I know many influencers using this app to make a few celebs uncomfortable for every comment, like, repost, or whatever they make. One of my fav comedians just deleted his account as a few of them targeted and thrashed him again and again.

Titles sell best here — IIM, IIT, Big MNCs, Job Titles and more. I understand there’s nothing wrong, but people are bound to accept a view of a titled person rather than a core idea, argument, or whatever he proposed. But if your title is great, then people just follow you without any reason after all. That’s the reason there are so many fake catfishes on this app after all.

Girls in this app have a different engagement metric. All you need for 100s of followers is just letting them know you are a girl — and whatever you do, you will get engagement. And feminism posts just get you 100s of dollars of payout.

The whole problem here is — getting paid engagement is great for maybe brands, big creators, and more. But it just ruins your whole experience of social media if that is not the case.
I know how many fan war groups, communities, and more just shitpost on influencers and more — by just paying money and getting engagement. Either it’s film industry, cricket, or whatever.

This is the biggest blunder from Elon. He might see a spike in revenue, but not the experience, not the uniqueness this app held for years now. All went down so bad. No more great debatable posts. That’s the core reason many people whose tweets I wanted to read are completely out of this app.
That’s the reason I cut down a lot of my time on this app. But still, as this app offers few perspectives, outliered people who are afraid to be on Instagram or anywhere else — I come back often to check out if I got something good to see.
