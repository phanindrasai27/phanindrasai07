See everyone can build a mediocre product which solves the problem maybe in a specific niche way for some differential market with other competitors but here you don't make your consumer remember you. 

You make it by benchmarking if your industry works on tech, automobile or as such it works on benchmarking such as how fast the vehicle goes, how fast the apps open. How fast is the mobile processor.

But when you are very different from all the competitors that you build your brand in many pillars of attention such as blocking your consumer with an ecosystem such as apple does. Blocking your consumer with fame, rich appearance and rich status is the same as apple.

But magic is not about being best, it's not about fame, rich or benchmark standing. But it's more about you solving the customer problem but you add some small intuitive gestures, specific problems that make them surprised, smile and want to share that specific thing with their friends and family.

That's where you bring a smile, make their journey with your product memorable and can increase your chances of people referring your products to others as well.

It's very hard to do. It may go wrong in many senses. It may not work with everyone. It should not bother those who do not understand. 

But I definitely need to make a change for a person who understands and had a great day because of it.
