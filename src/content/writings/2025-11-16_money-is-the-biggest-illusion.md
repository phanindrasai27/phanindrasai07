Let’s start with how it all began. Way back, we became a reasonably forward society. We invented many things ourselves that made our lifestyle better, safer, and more convenient to live in terms of footwear, clothing, farming, coal, spices, vegetables, and more. Many people were better at one thing and started doing that for a living.

Now, the biggest part is that people didn’t use to buy things then, as there was no money at all. So they traded stuff. Then they realized that trading wasn’t so convenient, effortless, or mutually beneficial, because what if the other person didn’t want the item being offered? So people started valuing things that were limited. They began valuing gold, silver, and diamonds as trading options. Later, they moved to copper and other metals shaped into coins.

After that, we created governments, and everything got democratized. We started making notes and coins as currency, and this is the era when everything started becoming disproportional. An economy-based world emerged, and now the currency was not limited anymore, because if the government wanted more money, it could print as much as it wanted.

This happened because limited metals, ores, and resources were already distributed unevenly among countries through wars, colonization, and looting. Since everything was scarce in terms of natural items, governments wanted a more convenient currency that depended on game theory. So currency came into existence, and distribution began.

Money was created, but money doesn’t guarantee that you can own or buy a product in reality, because what if the prices are too high or too low?

Then economies and financial markets started, and trading expanded across countries. Digital markets began piling up. Now you can store money on your mobile or in computer servers. You can invest your money in a company that tries to progress, make our civilization better, and make our lives more productive.

Now companies’ valuations are estimated in seconds and invested in millions. The wealthiest man in the world is the one who runs a business whose financial stocks top that country, and all this money exists only on digital screens. Once he tries to withdraw it, the whole currency value shrinks, and what he actually gets is negligible compared to what he was estimated to have.

People started getting loans, credits, and mortgages while their income is 0.01% of what they earn in a month. This is the reason numerous financial crashes, tragedies, and more have happened. In the name of capitalism, we are stuck in a well-planned system where we buy GPU computation in the name of crypto, where everything is an illusion.

You never pay a fair price for anything. You never get a fair value for anything. But if you ask me what we are paying all this for, it’s pure progress, civilization, and a future-forward economy.

In the end, everything gets meaningless. There comes a time when nobody needs to work, and nobody gets paid a salary. We eventually get paid by the government to spend our money wisely on living, on the basic needs of food, shelter, education, healthcare, and maybe even travel.

In the end, all we want is a decoupled system that works without any human effort, and we are near that Artificial Intelligence era where you don’t need to work at all. Capitalism makes you work harder; it is a very well psychologically, philosophically, and progressively planned system that makes this happen, in which money seems to be the target, but it is just an illusion.
