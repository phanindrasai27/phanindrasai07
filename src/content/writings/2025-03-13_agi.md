To achieve anything, we first need to define what it actually is. Throughout history, no major invention was achieved without first defining it clearly.

Yet, every time a new SaaS tool or a robotic update drops, people start claiming AGI is here. The reality? We haven’t even discovered the core meaning of AGI yet. True AGI will emerge when we are fully surrounded by AI—living between AI-driven technology, models, and machines.

First, Define AGI.

Today → Multi-agent automation.

Tomorrow → One-click design.

A year later? → Fully autonomous, self-driving vehicles.


Without a clear definition, AGI remains a moving target. If you can’t define it, you can’t achieve it.

As Deutsch says, progress is inevitable.

People fear AGI, thinking it will bring a dystopian future or even the end of the world. But if AGI is the "end," does that mean achieving it is failure? The same logic applies to black holes, multi-planetary humanity, or any great unknown. The best we can do is being Rational optimists.

Again, as Deutsch says:
Problems are inevitable, and so is progress.
