India’s traffic woes stem from a mix of rapid population growth, urbanization, and lagging infrastructure. As our cities expand, so does the number of vehicles. Unfortunately, this growth hasn't been matched by efficient urban planning or timely infrastructure development.

In many global cities, even with dense populations and high vehicle counts, public transport systems are strong and reliable. Their cities were planned better and evolved with the needs of the people. In contrast, many Indian cities expanded without proper planning—often lacking wide roads, footpaths, and efficient drainage systems. This becomes painfully evident during the rainy season when water stagnation turns roads into rivers, and vehicles struggle like boats.

Another root issue is poor city layouts. Unlike the grid-based patterns seen in many international cities, Indian cities often grew around old routes and settlements. Once a city is built without a plan, it’s not something we can restructure easily—unlike rearranging a layout in Clash of Clans.

Moreover, we lack dedicated bypasses and terminals for heavy vehicles. Container trucks and intercity traffic often move right through city centers, adding to congestion.

Beyond infrastructure, behavior plays a key role. In many developed countries, people with multiple personal vehicles still choose public transport for daily commutes. In India, it's common to see large cars with just one occupant, unnecessarily clogging roads. Even switching to two-wheelers for solo travel could significantly reduce traffic and emissions.

Solving this requires both government action and public cooperation. Better planning, faster construction, reliable public transport, and responsible commuting habits are essential if we hope to untangle the mess on our roads.
