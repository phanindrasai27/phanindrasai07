As a middle-class consumer, I find myself, like many others, caught in a cycle of endlessly searching for the “best” products — whether it’s hair oil, healthcare products, tech gadgets, bikes, or even fashion items. The modern marketplace seems designed to confuse, making us indecisive and overwhelmed by choices. From push marketing tactics to pull strategies based on legacy brands, the options have become seemingly endless over the past decade.

What complicates matters further is that even trusted legacy brands are often criticized by influencers or labeled as unhealthy. The sheer number of choices — from hair loss oils advertised on Instagram to discounted products on platforms like Zepto — pulls us into an unending cycle of exploration. We buy a product on sale, use it briefly, then forget about it and move on to the next. This cycle is particularly prevalent in the middle class, where many of us fall victim to market traps and scams, wasting time, money, and even risking our health in the process.

While some brands claim that their products need to be used for a year or more to see real benefits, middle-class consumers often jump from one product to the next, driven by offers and discounts. This habit of constant experimentation prevents us from fully realizing whether a product works as intended.

Interestingly, the rich don’t face the same issue. They tend to opt for premium brands that are optimized for specific needs, often based on professional advice. They avoid the traps of endless choice because they invest in products that are designed to work, no matter the price. On the other end of the spectrum, poorer consumers stick to legacy brands like Colgate or affordable shampoos, not because they don’t care, but because they don’t have the means to explore other options.

The middle class, on the other hand, is uniquely vulnerable to these traps. Consulting firms and big brands target this demographic with strategies that exploit our constant search for better, more affordable products. In doing so, the middle class has become the go-to market for brands eager to push their latest offerings.

**The Premium Product Trap**

Every segment of the market is now flooded with “premium” products, often priced at double or triple the cost of regular options in the name of being organic or superior. Upper-middle-class consumers often feel pressured to buy these products, but in many cases, they end up wasting hard-earned money on goods that don’t necessarily deliver on their promises.

**The Solution**

The problem isn’t about whether we’re buying expensive or cheap products; the real issue lies in our inability to stick with one product for an extended period. Many brands claim that their products need consistent use over a year to show results, but we rarely give them that chance. Instead, we move from one product to the next, never really knowing whether a particular brand or formula could have worked for us.

The solution to the choice paradox is simple: reduce your discovery radar and stick to one product for a longer period. By doing so, you save time, energy, and mental space that would otherwise be spent on constant searching. This approach allows you to avoid falling victim to market traps, random ads, and short-term offers.

By committing to a single product, you not only give yourself a better chance to see its real effects but also free yourself from the exhausting cycle of consumer experimentation. This shift in mindset can bring greater clarity and help protect your mental health, financial well-being, and overall satisfaction.
