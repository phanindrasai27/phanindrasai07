This is my take on Bryan Johnson, who preaches the ideology of **“Don’t Die”** — a man who claims he is going to live forever and ever. He is doing countless experimental things on his body, many of them risky, and constantly measuring everything. He even openly states that if there were an Olympic gold medal for being the healthiest person on Earth, he would win it. He believes humans can live forever, and he is kickstarting that process by becoming the fittest and lowest bio-age person in the world.

But here’s the thing — considering him as an individual, as an influencer, following everything he does would be fooling yourself. He is **very rich** and spends millions every year on his body from every possible aspect. He has a fixed 8-hour sleep schedule, eats only fruits, nuts, and fiber, and follows a strict, repetitive diet. He lives his life like a fixed timetable when it comes to health.

Now, coming to proven data — many studies claim that the human brain cannot function beyond 120 years at full potential, the heart has a max lifespan of 200 years, the liver up to 300 years, and so on. Many also state that he has undergone **botox treatments and commercial beauty regeneration processes**, which is not “de-aging” but more like makeup on himself.

The fact that he **cannot even stay in a room with an AQI of 120**, while in most Tier 1 cities the average is **150**, is both concerning and eye-opening. He has turned every eyeball toward him with his statements, but it raises a bigger question — **is it even practical to be this robotic, this scheduled, this obsessed about something as simple as AIR?**

And beyond that — **how many years do you even want to live? What do you do with those years?** Life already seems meaningless to many within an average lifespan of 60 years, so what happens when you stretch it indefinitely?

Coming to me, I would say this — **live as long as you can, but with your organs functioning at their best.** Try to maintain good numbers for your body, physically and mentally. But for that, **you can’t be a robot.** You can’t measure everything, every single day. People can’t afford all this, people struggle to afford even a **yearly gym membership** — how can they change their entire lifestyle, tastes, and habits overnight?

More than **90% of people are struggling with basics** — their sleep schedule is a joke, their organs are dying from **junk food, alcohol, cigarettes,** and whatnot. You **can’t even be 1% of Bryan Johnson** unless you’re that rich and can dedicate your entire life to this. **And you don’t need to be.**

## Impact — More Than Just an Experiment

See, whatever Bryan Johnson has done — food, exercise, supplements, **injecting his own child’s plasma** (yes, that too), and possibly even **non-legalized** things — **he’s not just doing this for himself.**

Now, don’t look at this from just his perspective. **Look at the impact on society, on humanity, on people’s perception of health.**

He is so rich that he **could have done all this quietly** on some private island, lived like a normal fitness enthusiast, and still made money from his Blueprint company. But he **chose to make an impact.** He chose to shake people up and make them question — **WTF are we even doing with our bodies, our lives?**

There are **thousands of influencers** talking about the basics — “exercise, eat healthy, sleep well” — but did anyone care? People follow them, but it doesn’t **truly concern them.** It doesn’t **wake them up.** They just scroll past these influencers as if they are yapping for no reason.

But then comes **this billionaire, spending millions on himself, landing in India for collaborations, and openly walking out of a podcast because the AQI was worse than he expected.** Suddenly, everyone is talking. People are **going bonkers.**

Now, people are **worried about their health, their body, their food.** They are feeling **FOMO — are they falling behind? Are they dying earlier than they should?**

**This is impact.**

He doesn’t just do things — **he does them in an extreme, mind-blowing way** that makes even the most unhealthy person **fear for their life.**

Now, suddenly, the whole of India is **talking about AQI, longevity, bio-age, human diagnostics, and more.**

Like, **he literally taught people more technical health jargon than any fitness influencer in the past year.**

He **shook up India’s health conversation** in a way that made **everyone** stop and think about their lifestyle. **What they eat, how they sleep, what they breathe.**

I call this **“Extreme Impact.”**

These kinds of people **make you rethink everything.** Your life, your habits, your perspective. And **he didn’t have to do this.** He could’ve just lived his life, done his biohacking, and enjoyed his millions. But no — **he chose extremism to wake people up.**

At least for the past few days, **India is awake.**

## Final Thoughts

So, does everyone need to be like Bryan Johnson? **Hell no.**

Just be **aware.** Maybe he’s right. Maybe he **will** live forever. But **nothing is proven yet.**

**Just get your basics right.**
- Sleep well.
- Eat a balanced diet.
- Move your body.
- Stay fit.

**There is nothing more important than staying fit.**

It solves **99% of your problems.**

Maybe in the future, Bryan Johnson will be exposed as a scammer. **Or maybe he’ll be proven right.**

But whatever happens, **the impact he made is real.**
And that impact won’t vanish.

**Peace ✌🏻.**
