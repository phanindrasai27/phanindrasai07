Everyone can build a mediocre product that solves a problem in a specific niche or differentiates in the market against competitors. But that doesn’t make your consumer remember you.

You make them remember by benchmarking—whether your industry is tech, automobiles, or anything else. It’s about how fast the vehicle goes, how quickly the app opens, how powerful the mobile processor is.

But true differentiation goes beyond that. You build your brand across multiple pillars of attention—locking consumers into an ecosystem like Apple does, creating a status symbol of fame, wealth, and exclusivity, again like Apple.

Yet, magic isn’t about just being the best. It’s not just about fame, wealth, or standing at the top of benchmarks. It’s about solving the customer’s problem while adding small, intuitive gestures—little surprises that make them smile, moments that make them want to share your product with friends and family. That’s where you create an emotional connection, making their journey with your product memorable and increasing your chances of organic referrals.

It’s hard to do. It can go wrong in many ways. It might not work for everyone. But it should never frustrate those who don’t get it. Instead, it should create a moment of change for those who do—those who end up having a great day because of it.
