Hello peeps, mainly Indians and most importantly teenage and mid-20 people who are very much struggling with family toxicity which affects your life, study, job and constant Mood. I am here to share my experience and some tips, suggestions and importantly how to find peace from all the Home chaos happening. Hope you stay till the end.

## “A calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love. These things cannot be bought — they must be earned.”

This is one of my favourite lines of mine from Naval Ravikanth. which made me think about does we can even live a life in peace in our household. we are very much ok with that, we do not see it as a drawback that people never questioned that. but this is one of the most effective things that control your whole mood of the day, your life confidence, and how kind of a human you will grow up.

Many say Indians have the lowest divorce rate in the world. I would say it is all about fighting, arguing and spreading toxicity, fighting over small things, not understanding others. does it even matter if they are divorced or not? choosing divorce and getting peace will make it much better. in the name of religion, what other people think, what will happen to our children and all different reasons. this person just living a toxic, unpeaceful life that they don’t even realise that they are not living but just killing their children day by day from inside.

Research shows children who raised in toxic families are often tend to be under-confident, Introverted, passionless and have more habits and thoughts of a psychopath. all this mess, chaos daily 2 or 3 times. they are making it hard for their children who come back from school of 8 to 9 hours to have a good sleep and a peaceful life.

There can be both husband and wife toxic or one of them can be toxic. whatever the condition things will be hard for the children and the others. main characteristics of the people are over-possessive, always talking only gossip, narcissistic kinda behaviour, very self-centred, can’t accept the truth, they live in a deep well of lies which are created by some random babas, past beliefs and more that they don’t change and won’t let you change your life. they are far away from reality, science and scientific facts. They only believe in god said, tradition over the years and their parents said bullshit and they stick these lies and myths to you and your life.

The main scenarios of these people would be they don’t live and they don’t let you live, they always want to happen what they want even for you, and they always play the victim card with others when they end up in a fight with you. they always try to make you angry and make you say cuss words or more and then tell others only what you said but not the whole story. they are more like ask you what you want and then they just do what they want to. always tries to involve household neighbours and play a victim card and try to make you bad in front of others. they try getting back as many people as possible on their side and try to feel alone and losers.

## So what is the solution:

Just try to leave that place as soon as possible this is the only solution, become independent and live your life by yourself. this is the only option you have. because you can’t change them which leads to much more toxicity. you can’t convince them this leads to more toxicity. you either act around them that you like what they do and just keep calm and bark whatever they want and never try to argue. their only target is to make you angry, bad, unpeaceful.

All these people who were born after 2000 have huge gaps in knowledge, beliefs and illiteracy Gaps that make their lives miserable. because you will never accept what they do and they will never your way. so just get out stay away and live your peaceful life. That is the only solution.

All the above scenarios, examples and characteristics I mentioned are in my family, tried many times to change them but it became worse, tried convincing them it became worse and started acting good with whatever they said and now trying to leave home ASAP.

All the current Gen people who are getting married or going to be married. remember you can earn millions and more. but a happy and peaceful home and life come within yourself. try to live a happy and peaceful life that changes the dynamics of our lives and our future generations. let’s try to break this loop of toxic households and start living a peaceful, happy and meaningful life.

Thank you very much for staying till the end. hope this helps you to some positivity and much more. will meet you next time.
