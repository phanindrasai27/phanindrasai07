As you guys may have known by now, the new ChatGPT-4o model specialized in image generation is out for premium users only 😔. But you know what’s the vibe after all? It's just Ghibli Studio anime vibes all over X (Twitter). Everyone is so happy sharing their Ghibli pictures and what they made out of it—but not the owner of the Ghibli art studio, not the designers, not the artists who draw, paint, and do digital art with their own hands to pay their bills and more, to be precise.

The only thing that even I am skeptical of is that, over time, people said AI would be doing all the robotic, computer-based, and very manual jobs. But here is ChatGPT making fucking sick images of people's own pictures, turning them into pieces of art that are worth as much as the current monthly subscription to the same model. And this method is much more convenient, seamless, and offers many choices to pick from. So is it bad? Is it even ethical that AI can generate images in an art studio vibe so easily when artists work for years to achieve the same?

First, tech jobs got hurt because the diversity of the tech world is so low. All the documentation, code architectures, and much more—including tons of example codes and datasets—made it easy for AI to adapt. Now, since we have so much digital art, movies, anime, and other digital media, it’s just as easy for AI to generate art. Now, divisions are opening—one company builds robots for manufacturing units, one for drainages, one for mining maybe, and so on. The more niche and controlled the environment, the stronger, more adaptive, precise, and accurate the AI model can be.

Does it mean artists are in trouble? Not really. As they say, "AI will not replace you, but the person who uses AI will definitely replace you." The same applies to artists, product designers, infographic creators, and digital designers in general. Maybe they just prototype stuff in the beginner form and then use AI to create choices. See? Now everything becomes about choices. Every interface will have options. It’s not a surprise that, in the future, people will have dynamic and even real-time interfaces tailored to their consumer experience in apps, websites, or anything specific. Initially, you can make your app more welcoming rather than cluttered, gradually unlocking features over time. The overall experience will be interesting, dynamic, and as convenient as you want.

AI is making everything easier so that people can take action. Just think about it—if you wanted to start a project 5 to 10 years ago, you had to think twice, start coding, plan stuff, architect things, integrate them, and push them to the cloud. But that’s not the case now. You can build a website in hours, an app in a week, and create marketing infographics, memes, and images in minutes. Now, it’s all about how you articulate things. What’s your taste? How do you shape consumer experiences to be convenient and dynamic? Anything digital is officially at your fingertips. You just need to take action, and things get easier, cheaper, faster, better, and more adaptive over time!

The future seems skeptical, anxious, and non-adaptable because of job loss. The past seems dumb because we spent days and months doing things that now take minutes. But the present? The present is beautiful—just like a Ghibli Studio anime.
