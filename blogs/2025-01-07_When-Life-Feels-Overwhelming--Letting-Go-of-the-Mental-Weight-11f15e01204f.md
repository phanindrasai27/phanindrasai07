When you work in any tier-1 city, don't have many friends outside of the office, and face terrible days at work, life can feel unbearable. It shifts your weekend plans from fun activities to pondering the "meaning of life." You can't share your feelings with anyone because the conversations you have with most people are superficial. Even if you try to open up, they might not truly understand because it’s a feeling that needs to be experienced to be grasped.

This can lead to thoughts of escaping—from the job, the city, and all the responsibilities—just to be at home, peaceful and happy, without meetings or stress. But please wait. This is just a temporary cliffhanger that makes everything feel heavy and overwhelming.

Talk to that one friend you trust in the office. Talk to that one close friend, no matter where they are in the world. Don’t let these temporary feelings ruin your future. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t leave your job—it simply means that the decision to leave should be based on how much you like your work, your colleagues, your role, and other relevant factors.

If you genuinely dislike the work, then leave. If you don’t like the place you’re staying in, move somewhere else. But don’t let one disturbance destroy all the good things around you. Don’t rush to fix everything at once, and don’t think these feelings will last forever. Everything is temporary—from the vacation you’re taking to the job you’re doing.

Don’t walk away from something because of an emotional impulse. Think rationally, set your emotions aside for a moment, and reflect. Write down your thoughts. Take action only after enduring an unbearable month. If it’s truly bad, bear it until you’re certain you’re ready to give up.
