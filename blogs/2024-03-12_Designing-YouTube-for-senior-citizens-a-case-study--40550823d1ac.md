## The context behind this case study

I have seen many old age people wanted to get entertained by youtube, but they dont have great user experience with youtube. as it became optimal and easy for tech saavy people. so i thought likewise youtube kids why not atleast a youtube senior citizens atleast an in app optimization. i understood this can only be for the present older generation. even tough as age increases they have many problems such as eye sight etc. so this is the case study as an app for the senior citizens.

## User Personas:
- X — 60 year old home maker, have a slight knowledge of phone usage. Have some sight. Watches cooking videos and serial episodes.
- Y — 70 year old ex doctor, have mid age knowledge of phone. Watches tech videos, vlogs videos and podcasts
- Z — 80 year old land lord , have a mild knowledge of phone, watches cinemas, political stuff and regional stuff.

I would like to focus on X, Z mostly. As Y is more tech savvy kinda person. They don’t need special care as much as others. His interests may be somewhat different from this people.

## User Journey:
- Opens app and asks child or other to find cooking videos or want to see an old favourite move and want them to watch again.
- Sees the movies as much as he can.
- Comes back and recalls the movies he wanted to watch and asks to find again.
- Completes the movies.
- Then shares about it to friends or more.

## Pain points:
- History needs to be on their basic platform for old age people. Because they wanted to continue the stuff mostly.
- Searching content is a big pain for them
- Get confused due to numerous options.
- Sharing with social group will be tough.
- Be on date with political stuff and some movies stuff.

## Solutions:
- Having a separate mode for old people. Which will be not very confusing and we need an AI recommendation model which don’t get too diversified and often gives minimal explorations and watched things before.
- Having high fonts and caption fonts need to be increased.
- Voice search option position and its use need to be optimised by this their searching problems will be reduced.
- Recently stopped videos should be their main priority. Which are paused in between.
- We make sharing very easy and minimal for them only having YouTube sharing will be a great idea and optimising it well will be great.
- Optimising their feed based on their sharing will be a best option as it gives a great reference about their social group.

## Prioritisation:

Mush have:1, 2, 3, 4

Should have : 5, 6

Nice to have: what’s app integrations.

## Metrics:
- Increase in their screen time.
- Usage of voice search .
- Sharing in group.
- Avg no of videos watched.
- Avg no of recall videos completed.
- Push notifications videos watched.
- Videos watched by search/ videos watched by recommendation.
- Avg session time.
