EatSure is a cloud-based food platform where you can order from 10 or more food brands in a single order. The best part? Their strategy seamlessly integrates the experience of jumping from one food stall to another within the app itself.
- They keep their prices generally high, targeting wealthy or busy customers who don’t mind paying a premium. For them, these prices seem normal. But for a middle-class person — who is into coupons, extra freebies, or redeeming coins for a Coke or more — EatSure becomes a playground of offers and strategic ordering.
- The most hooking part of this app is how all food places are integrated. Their “Buy 1 Get 1” offer allows you to get a biryani with a pizza — two items that are usually unrelated. This makes it appealing to both types of users: those who don’t care about pricing and will order whatever, and those who are price-conscious and will strategize their order to get the best deal.
- The usual ordering process on any food delivery app looks like this:Browse food → Check offers → Add items → Try applying coupons → Place order.
- But EatSure changes the game:Check offers → Browse across different restaurants → Add items from multiple brands in one cart → Review pricing → Place order (or dig deeper into loopholes for extra savings).

If you’re smart about it, you can explore different coupon hacks, mix and match the right food items, and get food worth ₹1000 for just ₹450 by using the best deals.
- The funniest part? Sometimes, items are costlier on EatSure than on Swiggy or Zomato — and sometimes, it’s the other way around.
- One day, an item might cost ₹600, and the next, you could get it for ₹200. Why? Maybe they want to push that product, let people experience its taste, or simply clear out excess stock.
- EatSure operates at a much lower cost compared to Swiggy and Zomato because it is owned by Rebel Foods, which runs its cloud kitchens. Unlike traditional marketplaces, they don’t have to pay commissions to third-party restaurants — just delivery fees — giving them a higher profit margin.
- Their business model caters to both the rich and the middle class, with their core target audience being tech-savvy college students and working professionals.
- Another interesting feature is their complimentary dessert or drink system. Based on your total bill, you unlock free add-ons: for every ₹400 spent, you get to choose a progressively better freebie. This adds a layer of excitement and ensures that every meal feels complete.

## How EatSure is Competing with the Giants

They aren’t just another food delivery service — they’re offering a **complete package**:
- A “hooked” ordering experience that encourages strategic decision-making.
- The ability to mix and match foods from different brands in one order.
- Cost advantages over traditional food delivery platforms since they own the kitchens.
- A smart combination of discounts, collaborations, and offers to make ordering feel like a “game.”

## The Downsides
- Their food is mostly fast food, not healthy or suitable for daily consumption.
- Delivery times can be longer.
- Their pricing isn’t always attractive for frequent orders.

However, their pricing strategy is **perfect for group orders** — if you’re with three or more friends, it’s much more cost-efficient. Essentially, they’re targeting **college students, friends hanging out, and office employees looking for an occasional cheat meal.**

EatSure is like the digital version of a food court — where once in a while, you and your friends gather to indulge in a mix of different, mostly junk, foods. And that’s exactly what makes it stand out.
