As Ray Dalio said, credit is the key driver of an economy and significantly improves people's lives.

Food and groceries are essential, recurring needs. Maybe they should be available on direct credit, giving the middle class an edge by ensuring they don’t have to compromise on necessities. Many products are targeted at a specific consumer base but end up being used by others due to reach, trust, skepticism, or fear of wasting money. Credit could help these consumers access better products, personalized options, and higher-quality food whenever needed.

However, this comes with risks—overspending, delayed payments, and credit mismanagement. If only quick commerce companies offer this, they’ll need robust mechanisms to determine creditworthiness, control excessive spending, and manage defaults. Early-stage or rapidly growing companies may struggle with these complexities, as their focus could shift away from core operations. If non-payment issues escalate, recovering funds will be a massive challenge.

Yet, with the lifestyle ecosystem built by Blinkit and Swiggy, this could be a game-changer. It has the potential to reshape consumer behavior, improve accessibility, and strengthen the economy while benefiting families.

To mitigate risks, companies should adopt a phased approach. Initially, they could offer credit to high-spending users (e.g., those spending above a certain threshold on Zomato monthly). Users would need to link a bank account for automatic monthly repayments, say on the 7th (Thala for a reason). PAN-based checks could help assess transaction history, daily cash flow, and financial stability.

Offering no-interest credit for a month, bundled with a premium subscription plan (including benefits like free delivery), could further differentiate the service. This would make consumers more reliant on quick commerce and quick food delivery, reducing the need for bulk grocery shopping. People would become more flexible, open to new products, and shift from monopoly brands to sustainable, customized, and homegrown alternatives.

This shift would benefit both consumers and the economy. Leverage is the most powerful tool a middle-class person can use—when managed wisely, it improves lives. If Blinkit and Swiggy implement in-app credit effectively, the impact will be massive. Betting high on this shift, and it will be fascinating to watch.
