The chances of a person not getting enlightened by the beauty of this life get near zero when a person joins humanity or the arts. Because they are meaningless for many and finding meaning in them is quite hard to be precise. That's the reason most artists are specialized in others.

Most parents—especially Asian ones—drag and force their kids into tech, medicine, or government jobs because these fields guarantee financial stability. But money alone is not a moat for people. Still, the chances of going broke in arts and humanities are undeniably high.

STEM teaches you logic, numbers, reasoning, and science. It opens your mind to the beauty and complexity of the world. The same goes for medicine, finance, or any field that provides a job.

Arts is different. Passion, authenticity, hard work, or sheer obsession mean nothing if you can’t get paid. Why should people like your aesthetics, taste, or the song you sang?

That’s why most artists and humanities graduates have a major or specialization in another field. They secure their livelihood first, then enter painting, music, cinema, or other artistic pursuits as a passion, obsession, or hobby.

This is also why nepotism and privilege dominate the arts industry. Most musicians, filmmakers, and artists come from money. You rarely see someone going from rags to riches.

That’s why arts and humanities aren’t "career paths"—they're hobbies, passion projects, or obsessions. I’d rather be a robotic SDE with a solid paycheck than struggle to get **100 views on a song—**unless it’s just a side passion or hobby.
