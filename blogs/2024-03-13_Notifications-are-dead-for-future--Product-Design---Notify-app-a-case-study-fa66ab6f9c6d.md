## Context behind this app:

I seen many people and even me whenever I open an app after long 4 to 5 hours we may have more than 100 notifications from numerous apps. And we do one slide to clear all and go to what we wanted to do eventually. In this process a person could leave many important notifications, emails and things behind to scroll his favourite reels or a game he wanted to play. Now-a-days people literally have upto 200 to 500 apps in many persons app. If there are apps for this many things and services. Why not an app for notifications that you get. It would make your phone clutter free and you just need to check your notify app to check what are the things going on in numerous apps he have involved in. Here we go the app named notify is here for your clutter free, easy to use and categorise your notifications.

## User personas:
- X -23 year old student applying jobs from numerous sites, apps and emails. he applied numerous jobs in numerous apps how could he keep track of all apps.
- Y -30 year old Hr manager: using numerous apps for her office work. How could she keep updated with that as she have 400 apps in her phone.
- Z -25 year old content creator having numerous apps and having tough time with numerous notifications from numerous social media apps. His phone is cluttered with 500 notifications a day probably.

I would focus on all three type of them as they have same problems and more than them I don’t think any others phone is as cluttered as them.

## User journey(for phones):
- After a long 4 hour of work opened phone
- Opens notify app and sees where he have notifications
- Redirects to that app and gives replies and get his work done

### 4. He categorise which apps he gives priority:
- Linkedin
- Email
- Whatsapp
- Some medical fitness app
- Jira
- Zerodha
- Small case
- Grow
- Paytm
- Phoneme

### 5. He categorises which apps are his 2nd priority:
- Instagram
- Twitter
- Medial
- Games
- Medium
- Inshorts
- He categorizes some pushed notification apps in 3rd priority mostly they are directly given third priority
- So firstly he gives priority to family, personal and professional by priority 1
- 2nd for his funny reels by friends, twitter trends and games
- 3rd which are mostly pushed notifications

## User journey(for laptop web app):
- Previously he may open email, LinkedIn, slack, WhatsApp and more as many tabs cluttered and very hard to focus on.
- Now he will only open one web app and sees what re imp and what are not.
- Same gives priority as given in phone

## Pain points:
- People have different priority for numerous apps. Everyone story with an app is not same.
- People wanted to keep their personal and professional things 1st priority
- Pushed notifs and the one which changes our lives.
- People wanted to see things in different forms in different times. Sometimes their priority. Sometimes clustered as domain (money, healthcare etc)

As this is the ideation time I can’t find anymore pain points at the time. I feel in the process and running the app may give much more context and user behaviour many more pain points for sure tough.

## Solutions:
- As said we provide customised category for people as per their interest as many priority as they want explained in user journey.
- We provide basic category of personal, professional and pushed notifs at a time and he can go through which one at a time as his mood.
- Even though email is a main app there will be pushed notifs as always. So we need an AI classify integration for the one which says you got a job and the one which says “congratulation you got a Loan”
- We have a top cluster behaviour as they want as per their priorities, personal lifestyle, professional notifs and by which money. You can filter as much as you want as seamless as you can.

## priortization:
- At the initial stage of the product I feel 1,2, 4 are must have features. As they are must have for our prototype or go to market app.
- As time goes we definitely need 3rd point which is ai model based classification.

## conclusion and how to make it work:

This idea seems very useful and very dumb at the same time but I feel the app should be as simple as possible. I feel if we are making the app to make it cluttered less for them the app should even be as simple as that. this app is more about how we make the app rather than how great an idea it is. At last it will be a prototype and there is very much more to do in future. We need to evolve as per consumer behaviour and their priorities, life style and the market.

Pls mention your view on this, how do you feel about the app and how is the product strategy. I wanted to know your views.

Thank you for reading till the end, follow and clap for the engagement.
