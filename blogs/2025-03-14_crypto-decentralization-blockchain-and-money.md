I've delved deeper into crypto coins today and realized they're completely usecaseless.

They’ve built a business around trading money, which adds no real value on a broad scale. The money you put doesn’t help companies build products or improve services—it just sits idle. In fact, your crypto money actually depreciates due to the incentives paid to community runners.

The entire system is sickly designed. They create communities to keep people engaged through staking and rewards—but those very incentives erode your holdings over time.

I believe in decentralization, especially Ethereum’s vision, which isn’t just about money but smart contracts, digital tokens, decentralized applications, and even games. Vitalik changed blockchain’s purpose from just a currency to something much bigger.

Think of it this way: When you're about to buy a car, that one finance bro always jumps in saying, “Don’t buy a car! It’s a depreciating asset!” Well, crypto (as money) is exactly that—just network-based pooling and gambling.

Why do you need decentralization in money? What does it add? Nothing. Sure, you don’t pay taxes on it, but the government won’t let you acquire real wealth without taxation. That’s why they slapped a 30% tax on crypto—and now nobody is even making profits.

Crypto is the future.
Decentralization is the future.
Blockchain is the future.

But crypto as money? Absolutely not. In the future, governments will adopt blockchain and decentralization for security and fault tolerance—but crypto as an alternative currency? That dream is dead.
